## App Idea
Audio journaling app - I would like to develope an aduio journaling app that allows users to record audio for journaling. Three are three features that I would like to implement for this application. First, transcribe audio to text. Second, genertate random prompts/ ideas for users in different categories: self-reflection, career related, professional development, etc. Third, custom reminder for users to set notification for journalling.
